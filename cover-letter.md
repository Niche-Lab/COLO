Dear Editors, 

I am writing to submit our manuscript titled "A Model Generalization Study in Localizing Indoor Cows with COw LOcalization (COLO) Dataset". Although AI-driven application in agriculture has been widely studied, a common challenges farm operators face is how well the existing models can generalize to their environment. This study use cow localization as a case study to investigate the generalization capabality under different conditions, such as environment lightning, model complexity, and camera view angle. This study also provides a new dataset, COw LOcalization (COLO), which can be used as a benchmark dataset for future research. We believe that this study will be of interest to the readers of Computer and Electronics in Agriculture, and we would be honored if you consider it for publication in your journal.

sincerely,
James
