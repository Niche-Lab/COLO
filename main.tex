\begin{abstract}

Precision livestock farming (PLF) increasingly relies on advanced object localization techniques to monitor livestock health and optimize resource management. This study evaluates the generalization capabilities of YOLOv8 and YOLOv9 models for cow detection in indoor free-stall barn settings, focusing on training data characteristics such as view angles, lighting, and model complexities. Using the newly released COws LOcalization (COLO) dataset, we examine three hypotheses: (1) Model generalization is equally influenced by changes in lighting conditions and camera angles; (2) Higher model complexity guarantees better generalization performance; (3) Fine-tuning with custom initial weights trained on relevant tasks enhances detection tasks. Our findings highlight considerable challenges in detecting cows from side views, emphasizing the importance of diverse camera angles in model development. Additionally, higher model complexity does not necessarily ensure better performance, as the optimal configuration depends on the specific task and dataset, necessitating careful model selection. Fine-tuning with custom initial weights offers advantages for complex models but provides limited benefits for simpler models. For simpler models, training with pre-trained weights proves more efficient, eliminating the need for prior relevant information that demands significant labor. Future research should prioritize adaptive methods and advanced data augmentation to enhance model generalization and robustness. This study delivers practical guidelines for PLF researchers to deploy computer vision models effectively, address generalization challenges, and leverages the COLO dataset containing 1254 images and 11818 cow instances to drive further research.
