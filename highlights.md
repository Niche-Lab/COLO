# Highlights

- This study provides guidelines for deploying an existing model in a new environment by evaluating its generalization in localizing cows within a free-stall barn setting.
- Camera angles significantly impact the model's ability to detect cows, more so than factors such as cow skin colors and lighting conditions.
- The study finds that higher model complexity does not necessarily lead to better generalization performance.
- The advantage of using fine-tuned weights from a relevant domain is limited when the model size and the available data are both small.
- A public dataset containing 1,254 images and 11,818 cow instances was released, offering a benchmark for indoor cow studies.
