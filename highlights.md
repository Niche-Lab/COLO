# Highlights

- This study provides guidelines for deploying an existing model in a new environment.

- Camera view angles impact the model performance more than variable lighting conditions.

- Higher model complexity does not necessarily yield better generalization performance.

- The advantage of fine-tuned weights from a relevant domain is not guaranteed.

- This study releases a benchmarking dataset with 1254 images and 11,818 cow instances.
